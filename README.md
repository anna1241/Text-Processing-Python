# Text Processing

## Overview
This repository houses a versatile Text Processing Toolkit designed to assist with various aspects of natural language processing (NLP). The toolkit includes functions for common text processing tasks such as removing stop words, normalizing data, identifying unique words, creating bag-of-words representations, computing TF-IDF scores, calculating cosine similarity, and ranking documents.

## Features
- **Remove Stop Words:** Efficiently eliminate common stop words from text data to focus on meaningful content.
- **Normalize Data:** Standardize text data by applying techniques like lowercasing, stemming, and lemmatization for consistency.
- **Unique Words:** Identify and extract unique words from a corpus, aiding in vocabulary analysis.
- **Bag-of-Words Representation:** Generate bag-of-words models to represent text documents as vectors for further analysis.
- **TF-IDF Calculation:** Compute TF-IDF scores to highlight the importance of terms in a collection of documents.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Measure the similarity between two text documents using the cosine similarity metric.
- **Ranking:** Implement document ranking based on specified criteria, providing valuable insights into document relevance.
